US20240144103A1,"Systems, methods, kits, and apparatuses for ai- driven digital twins for value chain network control towers","A VCN process may receive, by a value chain network digital twin, information associated with a value chain network. A VCN process may provide the information to a set of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based learning models, wherein at least one member of the set of AI-based learning models is trained to classify at least one of: an operating state, a fault condition, an operating flow, or a behavior of the value chain network and at least one member of the set of AI-based learning models is trained to determine a task to be completed for the value chain network. A VCN process may provide at least one of an instruction for executing the task in the value chain network digital twin and a recommendation for executing the task in the value chain network digital twin.",2024-05-02

US20240144141A1,"Systems, methods, kits, and apparatuses for using artificial intelligence for automation in value chain networks
","A VCN process may receive information associated with a value chain network. A VCN process may provide the information to a set of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based learning models, wherein at least one member of the set of AI-based learning models is trained on a training data set of a set of value chain network entities operating data to classify at least one of: an operating state, a fault condition, an operating flow, or a behavior of at least one value chain entity of the set of value chain network entities. A VCN process may determine a task to be completed for the value chain network based upon, at least in part, on an output of the set of AI-based learning models. A VCN process may execute the task to facilitate an improvement in the value chain network.",2024-05-02
US11734546B2,"Method and apparatus for recommending food and drink based on artificial intelligence-based user status
","A method and a device for recommending food based on an artificial intelligence based user status are disclosed. The method includes obtaining use information from a mobile terminal and an external terminal connected to the mobile terminal, determining a user status through an AI device, and determining a preferred food of the user based on the user status, thereby providing convenience for the user's life. The device for recommending food based on the artificial intelligence based user status can be associated with an artificial intelligence module, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a robot, an augmented reality (AR) device, a virtual reality (VR) device, devices related to 5G services, and the like.",2023-08-22
US10979625B2,"Method for editing image based on artificial intelligent and artificial device
","A method for editing an image based on artificial intelligence and an artificial intelligence device are disclosed. In the method for editing an image based on artificial intelligence, a recommended photographic composition is created by applying an image acquired by a camera to a pre-trained composition recommendation model, and the image is corrected based on the created recommended photographic composition, whereby it is possible to capture and edit an image at the same time without the trouble of correcting the image after capturing it. One or more of an artificial intelligence device of the present disclosure can be associated with artificial intelligence modules, drones (unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)), robots, augmented reality (AR) devices, virtual reality (VR) devices, devices related to 5G service, etc.",2021-04-13
